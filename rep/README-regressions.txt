*** All regressions ***

This readme file contains information pertaining to the regressions in the paper. 

As explained in "README-dataconstruction.txt", some of our data are proprietary. So, this replication package runs the regressions on pseudo data sets. 

"pseudostock.xlsx" is a pseudo data set for the stock return regressions and "pseudobalance.xlsx" is a pseudo data set for the balance sheet regressions.

a. do9pseudodataregressions - This file runs our main regressions (stock return and balance sheet) using the pseudo data sets above. By design, these do not reproduce the results in the paper.


For completeness, we also provide do files that need to be used in conjunction with the proprietary data to replicate our results.

b. do10stockregressions - This file runs all stock regressions in the paper.

c. do11balancesheetregressions - This file runs all balance sheet regressions in the paper.

d. do12tablesandfigures - This file produces all remaining tables and figures in the paper.

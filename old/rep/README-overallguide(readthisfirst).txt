*** An overall guide for the replication package ***

Here, we provide an overall guide for the replication package of "Stock Market's Assessment of Monetary Policy Transmission: The Cash Flow Effect" by Gürkaynak, Karasoy-Can and Lee. 

Stata is required to be able to run our replication files (we used Stata 14 and onward). 

The replication package consists of three parts. 

1. "README-datasetconstruction.txt" discusses how our data set is put together.

2. "README-hedgedata.txt" explains how our interest rate risk hedging indicator is constructed.

3. "README-regressions.txt" contains information pertaining to the regressions in the paper. 

Because some of our data are proprietary, this replication package works with pseudo data sets. Those who are mainly interested in our regressions are recommended to go straight to "README-regressions.txt." 

Our measures of monetary policy surprises and interest rate risk hedging are included in the replication package, in "GSSfactors.xlsx" and "hedgedata.xls" respectively. We also provide the raw data for calculating monetary policy surprises (in “GSSrawdata.xlsx”) together with the code (do1policysurprises).


If there is any question regarding this replication package, please do not hesitate to contact anyone of us.

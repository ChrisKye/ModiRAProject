Data was scraped using sec-api full text search api
PROBLEMS
- to search for specific phrases in exact order, api doesn't work
- resolved

Next Steps
- obtain new api key for 50,000 calls
- add write to csv functionality to save parts
- optimize & create requests for all gv_key
- test out merging false positives with Pilot

- WRDS only provides SAS full text search functionality
- prob better if we do it in sec-api
